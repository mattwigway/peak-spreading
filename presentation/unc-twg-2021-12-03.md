# Rush hour-and-a-half: Are peak hours spreading out?

Matt Bhagat-Conway, _University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill_<br/>

<!-- _class: two thirds columns blank -->

# Introduction

- Pre-pandemic, most urban areas struggled with rush-hour traffic congestion
- Travel patterns are likely to change post-pandemic
    - For instance, due to telecommuting and flexible work schedules

# Background and research question

- More people are expecting to telecommute post-pandemic (Salon et al., 2021)
- This may result in less peak-hour travel demand
- People working flexible schedules may spread their trips throughout the day
- **Hypothesis:** Peak times will be longer, but with less total traffic

# Data

- 8,102 traffic sensors in California from Caltrans PeMS
- Data in 5-minute increments since January 2016
- Sensors confined to freeway network
    - 81% urban

# Data

- Most sensors are loop detectors, some camera or radar detection
- Three outputs
    - Occupancy
    - Flow
    - Speed

# Defining the pre- and post-pandemic period

- "Post-pandemic" period: June 15–July 17, 2021
    - excluding weekends, holidays, days before/after holidays
    - No mask mandate in California
- Pre-pandemic period: Third Tuesday in June–32 days later
    - in each year 2016–2019
    - excluding weekends, holidays, days before/after holidays

# Theory

![Conceptual plot of relationship between occupancy, speed, and flow width:800px](flow_occ_theory.png)

---

# $k$-factors

- What percent of daily occupancy (or flow) occurs during the peak hour?
- Peak hour can start at any 5 minute increment
- Related to engineering $k$-factor, but defined at daily rather than yearly level

---

# Entropy

In math:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) \log P(x_i)$$

- A measure of disorderedness within a system (physics)
- A measure of how much "information" or "surprise" is conveyed in a random variable's outcome (information theory)
- A measure of diversity (ecology)

---

<!-- _class: two columns blank -->

# Entropy in occupancy

- Is occupancy distributed across the hours of a day in a "disordered" (highly entropic) or "peaky" (less entropic) way?

- A measure of peakiness beyond the peak hour. Two distributions with the same peak hour occupancy but different entropies:

# Methods

- For every sensor-day, calculate $k$-factors and entropy
- Compare pre-post pandemic

# Results

Measure | Value | Interpretation
:-------|:------|:--------------
Occupancy | -0.7% | Less peaky
Entropy | 2.9 centibits | Less peaky

---

# Statistical testing

- Post-pandemic data appears somewhat less peaky
- We use a _permutation test_ to determine if this is statistically-significant

---

# Permutation test

- Theory: if there was no change, any observation could have come from either period with equal probability
- Repeatedly shuffle days between pre- and post-pandemic periods and compute mean difference in $k$-factor and entropy
- Use these values to construct a _sampling distribution:_ how likely a particular mean difference would be if there were no change
- Compare observed difference to sampling distribution, reject null hypothesis of no change if difference more extreme than 95% of distribution

# How much are peaks really spreading?

- Robustness check: do peaks spread in both peak occupancy _and_ entropy?
- Answer: only half of sensors (51.1%) exhibit spreading in both measures.
- More peaks are spreading than growing

######
######

# Can peak spreading be explained by changes in flow and occupancy?

1. Fit a model on pre-pandemic data:

$$\log(\text{peak hour occupancy}) \sim \hspace{11em} \\1 + \text{avg daily occupancy} + \text{avg daily flow} + \hspace{1em}\\ \text{district} + \text{urban} \hspace{13em}$$

2. Predict the outcome using post-pandemic data: is the model still a good fit?

---

# Discussion

- Reduced peakiness results in increased roadway capacity

---

# Future research

- Is the story the same on local roads?
- How has the picture evolved since July?
- Is some of the change in peakiness due to increased crashes outside of the peak?
