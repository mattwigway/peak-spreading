# Rush hour-and-a-half
## Are peak hours spreading out?

Matt Bhagat-Conway and Sam Zhang

<!-- _class: two columns -->

# Introduction

* Pre-pandemic, most urban areas struggled with rush-hour traffic congestion
* Travel patterns are likely to change post-pandemic
    * For instance, due to telecommuting and flexible work schedules

# Background and research question

* More people are expecting to telecommute post-pandemic (Salon et al., 2021)

# Outline

* Research question and background
* Data [Matt]
    * Source, dates
    * Map of all sensors [all on urban freeways]
    * Missing data
    * What is a loop detector
    * Traffic volumes pre-post
    * Summary stats - urban/rural, region, morning vs evening peak (or generally time of day distribution)
    * Sample size
* Theory [Matt]
    * Occupancy vs flow vs speed
    * k
    * entropy [Sam + simulations]
* Methods and results: permutation tests
    * Permutation tests [Matt]
        * Disaggregate by region
    * Regression [Sam]
* Discussion
    * Increased utilization of road network
    * Future research
        * Can peak spreading ever reduce capacity?
        * Picture on local roads
        * Followup with newer data
        * Features of road that are correlated with changes in peakiness [Sam]
        * Increase in crashes/increased noise postpandemic?
