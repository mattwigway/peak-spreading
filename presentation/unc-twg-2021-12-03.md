# Rush hour-and-a-half
## Are peak hours spreading out?

Matt Bhagat-Conway and Sam Zhang

<!-- _class: two columns -->

# Introduction

* Pre-pandemic, most urban areas struggled with rush-hour traffic congestion
* Travel patterns are likely to change post-pandemic
    * For instance, due to telecommuting and flexible work schedules

# Background and research question

* More people are expecting to telecommute post-pandemic (Salon et al., 2021)

# Outline

* Research question and background
* Data [Matt]
    * Source, dates
    * Map of all sensors [all on urban freeways]
    * Missing data
    * What is a loop detector
    * Traffic volumes pre-post
    * Summary stats - urban/rural, region, morning vs evening peak (or generally time of day distribution)
    * Sample size
* Theory [Matt]
    * Occupancy vs flow vs speed
    * k
    * entropy [Sam + simulations]
* Methods and results: permutation tests
    * Permutation tests [Matt]
        * Disaggregate by region
    * Regression [Sam]
* Discussion
    * Increased utilization of road network
    * Future research
        * Can peak spreading ever reduce capacity?
        * Picture on local roads
        * Followup with newer data
        * Features of road that are correlated with changes in peakiness [Sam]
        * Increase in crashes/increased noise postpandemic?

# How much are peaks really spreading?

* Robustness check: do peaks spread in both peak occupancy _and_ entropy?
* Answer: only half of sensors (51.1%) exhibit spreading in both measures.
* More peaks are spreading than growing

# Entropy

In math:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) \log P(x_i)$$

* A measure of disorderedness within a system (physics)
* A measure of how much "information" or "surprise" is conveyed in a random variable's outcome (information theory)
* A measure of diversity (ecology)

# Entropy in sensor occupancy

* Is occupancy distributed across the hours of a day in a "disordered" (highly entropic) or "peaky" (less entropic) way?

* A measure of peakiness beyond the peak hour. Two distributions with the same peak hour occupancy but different entropies:

# Can peak spreading be explained by changes in flow and occupancy?

1. Fit a model on pre-pandemic data:

$$\log(\text{peak hour occupancy}) \sim 1 + \text{avg daily occupancy} + \text{avg daily flow} + \text{district} + \text{urban}$$

2. Predict the outcome using post-pandemic data: is the model still a good fit?
